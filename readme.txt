How to use:
* Download Runnable Jar file from ./Algo program/Algo.jar
* Save inside folder with given stops.txt, transfers.txt, and stop_times.txt
* run Algo.jar, for first time setup, let it run without stopping, you can see when this step is done in the console tab
  
  This step can take upwards of 10-15 minutes
* After its done generating the Floyd Warshall graph, the result is saved in graph.txt and paths.txt
* On subsequent boot startups, the program will be ready to run after only 10-15 seconds.
